# Python Basics README.md

This README provides an overview and explanation of the Python code snippets included.

## Introduction to Python

The code starts with a simple "Hello world" print statement followed by iterating through a list of cars.

## Variable

Demonstrates variable declaration (`name` and `age`) and string formatting techniques.

## Arithmetic Operator

Performs basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `//`) and prints the results.

## Calculator

Takes user input for two numbers and performs arithmetic operations on them, printing the results.

## Comparison Operator

Demonstrates various comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) and prints the results.

## Logical Operator

Demonstrates logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) and prints the results.

## Assignment Operator

Performs assignments with augmented assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `**=`, `//=`) and prints the results.

## Operators

Demonstrates usage of operators based on weather conditions.

## Functions

Defines and calls two functions: `greetings` and `area_of_rectangle`.

## Withdraw Money Function

Simulates a simple banking operation with a `withdraw_money` function.

## Loops

Demonstrates `for` loop and `while` loop with examples, including a decrementing while loop.

## Modules

Imports and demonstrates usage of `math`, `time`, and `random` modules.

## Area of Shapes Module

Imports a custom module `area_of_shapes` and calls functions from it.

## List

Demonstrates creation and manipulation of lists, including slicing.

## List Loops

Iterates through a list using a loop and prints each element.

## Dictionary

Demonstrates creation and manipulation of dictionaries.
